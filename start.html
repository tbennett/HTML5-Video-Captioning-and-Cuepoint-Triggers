    <h1>
        Creating Compelling User Experiences driven by Rich Media Playback
    </h1>
    <p>For your final project, you won't want to use all of the UI elements presented on this example. Rather, you will want to be selective of what custom UI comtrols you need and how you will manipulate the DOM and information presented dynamically.</p>
    <p>You do not need to use an iframe as the only option for displaying dynamic content. You can use any container element. You can display it using floating layers, sliders, tabs, iframes, etc. You are only limited by your imagination.</p>
    <p>Some UI controls are better made as a single control that toggles between states, rather than two separate buttons. The play/pause and mute/unmute controls are examples. Again, this example code is to clearly demonstrate the HTMLMediaElement API methods, properties, and events, not how to build the UI to use them.</p>
